# mobile-gallery
A tiny gallery, based on php, jquery with mobile upload function.

## Setup

* Copy all files to your webserver
• Browse to the gallery
• If you open the gallery with ?admin=true parameter, you can import, rotate and delete images
• Copy some images to /import directory and click "Import" Button
• You can also upload images from your mobile. There are many apps out there. I use ["Send With FTP"[(http://michael.totschnig.org/SendWithFtp/) on Android.
• Use the cron.sh for an automatically image import. You have to change the path in cron.sh!
